# Slope-Game

This game was developed as part of the process for applying as
an Phenomena App intern. It is a simple memory card style game meant
to help understand the equation y=mx+b. Each "pair" consists of a
picture of a graph card and an equation card. Players should
reveal cards by clicking on them. Each graph card contains a rough
sketch of a graph and has two coordinate points. Players should use
those two points to calculate the equation of the line. Then reveal
the graph card with it's matching equation card at the same time
to complete the pair.

There are 6 pairs of graphs and equations. They vary and have
negative slopes, positive y-intercepts and negative y-intercepts.
It is important to note that the graphs are not drawn to scale
and are just rough represnetations.

series. Sprites and remaining graphics were self-made.
